Python Assignment Questions

Programs based on sets:

Create a set with your name that consists of numbers from 1 to last two numbers from your reg_num.
From the existing set extract, the prime numbers and store it in a new set.
Create another set by name odd that extracts the odd numbers from the set name.
Find the common numbers in the list name and odd.
Create a set by name colors and include all your favourite colors in it. (Max number=7)
Create another set by name rainbow and include rainbow colors.
Apply union, intersection and symmetric on these two sets.
Create a set by name numbers from 1 to ‘n’.  Remove all perfect numbers from the set by using discard method. Give your feedback
From the same set numbers, apply remove method to remove palindrome numbers.
Observe and write the difference between discard and remove method.
 

Programs based on Tuples:

1.      Create a tuple with your 4 digits of regnum and its ‘n’ successors along with your favourite food items. Sort the tuple based on the second item.

Ex:

  N=10

   ( 7328,’pizza’,7329,’ice cream’, 7330,’milkshake’,…..)

   Sort the tuple based on the second item

2.      Write a program that has a list of positive and negative numbers. Create a new tuple that has only positive even numbers.

3.      Create a tuple within the tuple with the following

   Eg ( (multiples of 2 upto ‘n’), (multiples of 3upto ‘n+1),(multiples of 5 up to n+2), (multiples of 6 upto ‘n’+3))

       ‘n’ should be obtained from the user.

   Now compute the sum of elements in each inner tuple.

   Print the maximum element in each inner tuple.

4.        Work any 5 functions on tuple. Show with example. Any uniqueness which could be distinguished from the other data structures.

5.      Python program to print prime numbers from 1 to ‘n’.

6.      Python program to compute HCF and LCM of 2 numbers.

7.      Create a list with duplicate elements. From the list print the first and second best scores. DO NOT USE BUILT IN FUNCTIONS.

8.      Get your Registration number as string type.

   a) slice your name until you find first ‘b’.

   b) slice your registration number so that you should get the third part of your number (eg 21bce7001->7001).

   c) slice your branch and get the middle 3 letters.

   d) Slice your registration number from the beginning to end with a step of 2.

   e) Slice your number from the beginning to end with a step of 2 excluding the first and last character.
